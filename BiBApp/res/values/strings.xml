        <b>What is Born in Bradford?</b>\n\n
		Born in Bradford is a long term study of a cohort of 13,500 children, born at Bradford Royal 
		Infirmary between March 2007 and December 2010, whose health is being tracked from pregnancy 
		through childhood and into adult life. A birth cohort study is a powerful way of researching 
		into the many influences that shape our lives: our parents and our wider family, our genes, 
		the way we choose to live, the local environment, the services we access and how all these 
		come together to affect our health and well-being. The information collected from the BiB 
		families is being used to find the causes of common childhood illnesses and to explore the 
		mental and social development of this new generation.\n\n
		
		<b>The Born in Bradford Charter</b>\n\n
		Born in Bradford will:
	    learn why most Bradford babies are healthy but some babies and children get sick use what we 
	    learn to help plan ways to improve health for people in Bradford and elsewhere do this by 
	    getting information from mothers, fathers and babies about how they live, where they live, 
	    where they come from and all the other things that help make us stay healthy or that can make 
	    us sick work with families, community groups, health professionals and all those others whose 
	    actions can help to make Bradford a healthier place
